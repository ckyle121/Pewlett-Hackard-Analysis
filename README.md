Other tables that might help Hewlett-Packard with their search would be a table with the titles of those eligable for the mentorship program. The company is going to want to do its best to get a variety of employees in various positions into the mentorship program. Another table that might be useful would be a table that filters those eligable for the mentorship program by their titles. This would help Hewlett-Packard see how many eligable staffers they have to mentor the future positions of the company.
